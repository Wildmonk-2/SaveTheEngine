WELCOME TO SAVE THE ENGINE ~ SCRATCH 2022

I'm Wildmonk from Scratch I introduce my new scratch game name "Save the Engine" in this game there is an engine which you have to save him but pressing right and left arrow key, and if the spikes coming falling from the top touched to the engine then you will lose in the game. It is easy to play and understanding, there will be a start menu at beginning and if you want to replay the game, just reload the page.

If you want to play this game, just go to the file name "Save The Engine.html", this is just an introduction, others you can get in Game only at About Button Section.
